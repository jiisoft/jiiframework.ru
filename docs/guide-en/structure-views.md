Views
====

Views are part of the [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) architecture.
They are code responsible for presenting data to end users. In a Web application, views are usually created
in terms of *view templates* which are JS files containing mainly HTML code and presentational JS code.
They are managed by the [[Jii.view.WebView|view]] [application component](structure-application-components) which provides commonly used methods
to facilitate view composition and rendering. For simplicity, we often call view templates or view template files
as views.
